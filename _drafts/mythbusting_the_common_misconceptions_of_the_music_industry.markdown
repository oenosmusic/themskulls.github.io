### Myth busting - The common misconceptions of the music industry

When I was a kid,  I my friend's big brother had a keen interest for heavy metal.

### If you're on Spotify, you've made it. You're great.

Quoting my colleague without permission: "Wow, your music is on Spotify?? You must be really good."

Nope. It just means I had managed to put something together, upload some stuff, fill in a few forms and click a few buttons.

* You need to be signed to a record label to release music. Nope.
* You will make tons of money as long as your music is released. No, sorry, you won't.
