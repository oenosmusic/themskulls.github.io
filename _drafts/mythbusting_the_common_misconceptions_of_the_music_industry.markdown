## Myth busting - The common misconceptions of the music industry

### If you're on Spotify, you've made it. You're great

Quoting my colleague without permission: "Wow, your music is on Spotify?? You must be really good."

Nope. It just means I had managed to put something together, upload some stuff, fill in a few forms and click a few buttons.

### You need to be signed to a record label to release music

Nope. Releasing, especially digitally, is really easy and doesn't cost that much. Releasing on Bandcamp where you can sell you stuff is free, and Soundcloud provides a good platform to get early feedback. Physical releasing is a bit harder as you'll need to figure out how many copies to make / get made and handle logistics to distribute your stuff but it's perfectly doable all by yourself.

### You will make tons of money as long as your music is released.

No, sorry, you won't. The hardest bit is getting your music heard so people actually considering buying it. Streaming services, at least for now, do not equate to album sales and majority of bands get their income from touring, merchandise sales and such. I'll publish some sobering stats on streaming service income later on.

### Albums are the only way forward

Not quite. Most releases are nowadays drip fed by record labels to keep the artists in the public view and the charts as long as possible. Before the digital era singles were the way to go; a lead single would be released with the albums with subsequent singles following to keep the album afloat and to give extra visibility to the artist. The death of the album format has been long discussed without a conclusion, however, majority of music is consumed via playlists as individual songs. Now, I like albums and there are exceptions to this by genre. Albums in metal and the various sub-genres are still going strong! Lucky me.
