Spent two weeks travelling without planning in Vietnam in March 2016. Looks like I wrote down a lot of beer related things amongst the usual tips and tricks. 

### How to not get killed by traffic

There's no tube in the big cities. Public transportation is all buses for now (they're in the process of building a tube in Saigon though). Fuckloads of mopeds everywhere - it feels like your life is at risk when crossing the road and you have to take a bit of leap of faith but you'll get used to it after a while. Here's the procedure I used:

* Evaluate the speed of the mopeds that are hurling towards you 
* Establish eye contact with the one you think may come to your path and start walking 
* Maintain eye contact
* Whatever you do, do not stop in the middle of the road unless you are sure you will be hit by a vehicle. Continue walking slowly, the locals are used to going around people
* If you do fuck up and step on someone's path, smile and you may get a smile back in forgiveness. Sorted

You may also encounter the odd moped on the pedestrian paths when the locals get tired of the waiting in the traffic. Seems to be normal. 

### Shopping & pestering

People will talk to you and try to sell you shit you don't need. Don't buy it if you don't need it. 

Haggle in markets everyone said. Haggle more when buying suits and stuff. I didn't really buy anything so I didn't have a lot of experiences. 

There's quite a bit of relatively inexpensive art for sale in Vietnam if you're looking for decorations for your flat. They looked cool. One piece of advise is to check if the paintings are originals or copies of an existing piece if you're not well into your art (I am not).

### Coffee

You cannot go to Vietnam and not talk about coffee.

In a nutshell the coffee is great. Generally tasty everywhere but I'd try Trung Nguyen most expensive option once as it's unlike anything I've had. Which is also a bad thing as it was also one of the best coffees I've ever had anywhere on the planet and leaves you craving for more. Some of their shops also sell coffee beans, and similarly the higher price the better quality was true (I bought three bags of different ranges - awesome stuff) but make sure you buy a Vietnamese Coffee Phin to make it when you get back. 

## Saigon / Ho Chi Minh City

*Old and new meet in Saigon*

Pham Ngu Lao which is the so called backpacker area. Really busy and touristy, however, the locals take over the food places late evening. There are some horrendous bars and nightclubs there which I avoided like the plague. 

There's a craft beer bar nearer to the end (west) of Pham Ngu Lao which was awesome; some 7 microbreweries from around Saigon sold their tasty beers. Of course extremely expensive in local standards but coming from London not bad at all. 

Mostly walked around again which was nice. Missed the war museum as it was closed during lunchtime unfortunately.

## Hoi An

There's The Hill Station in Hoi An old town for craft beer. Nice IPAs have to say.
 
Cheapest beer in Hoi An you'll find from Cafe 41 and Cafe 43 (on the same street). It's 3000 dong which is like 11p if I remember correctly. It's a locally brewed Bia Hoi 'fresh beer' - light lager and I really liked it. Food is decent and very cheap. Bia Hoi can be found from quite a few places for around 6000 dong.

You'll have to buy a ticket to the old town by the way, I think it goes towards restoration of it. The temples are beautiful.

For later nights ... there was a place called Dive bar that was ran by a German dude, music was rock 'n roll. 
      
Two late really late night bars: 'Why Not?' which looked tacky as fuck and One Love (I think ... reggae).

... and yeah, there's a beach nearby.

## Train from Da Nang to Hue 

Absolutely *stunning* train ride from Da Nang to Hue. Don't get the ticket online as it's a rip off; buy from the train station ticket desk and it'll cost you a couple of pounds.

## Hue 

I found Hue a bit dull to be honest. The Imperial City is cool though but that's pretty much it.

## Hanoi 

I really liked the vibe of Hanoi. I don't really know what the places I went to were called in Hanoi as I mostly dined on the street. Generally I really liked just strolling around in Hanoi. 

* The Doors Cafe in Old Town has live music.     
* The Hill Station for a great Vietnamese IPA. Pricey for the local standards but they do a 241 at some hours.
* Had fantastic tofu in tomato sauce here http://www.bunchata.com/

When you get to Hanoi, there's a Viet aiport shuttle which costs 40 000 dong instead of at least 300 000 that cab will set you back. It'll take you to old town but you may need to walk for a bit, depending on where you're staying. Not a biggie and it's an interesting walk anyways.

## Ha Long Bay 

Definitely worth seeing. The quiet cruise for Bai Tu Long Bay I went to was amazing. They were saying the wooden boats are going away as they're not allowed to build them anymore. I stayed in a red wooden boat where my cabin was like a mix of all the Asian design + pirates. Really really cool.

*My cabin on the Dragon pearl cruise*

They took us kayaking around the limestone pillars (although there were rumours they may need to discontinue that due to some environment protection thing), a cave, a pearl farm and on a small boat ride around the bay.
