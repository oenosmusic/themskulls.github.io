A few people asked me recommendations for Budapest after a weekend trip there in October 2016. Perhaps other people would find it useful or at least entertaining. So here.

Here's a few things I didn't know about Budapest.

1. It is a proper culinary destination. The food is amazing and prices are decent
2. Wine! So much great wine! No one ever told me Hungarian wines are so bloody good
3. It is gorgeous. Could spend days walking around just staring at the buildings
4. People are extremely friendly and helpful
5. Shops and lots of cafes/restaurants are closed on Sundays

### Drink & Eat

The cuisine is heavy on the meat side but there seemed to be a few veggie options (and veggie restaurants) available too.

Top 5 for food

1. Borssó Bistro

Order anything and it seemed to be brilliant. Have your something with Villányi Montenuovo Cuvée 2012. Oh my. Oh my oh my my. What a fantastic full bodied red. 

2. Konyha - Friends for food 
https://goo.gl/maps/3dFuHmowur82
Fusion food. Great food. Awesome for lunch, relatively cheap too. 

3. Carne di Hall Étterem 
https://goo.gl/maps/4fHZwiT6Lw12 
Doesn't look like in the Google picture (much more modern nowdays - the waiter said they had moved) but fantastic. Have this, don't skip this: Szeleshat Cabernet Franc 2013. njam njam njam njam. 

4. Belvárosi Lugas Vendéglő

5. Bock bistro

Dinner place, a bit fancy. They have their own wines which is nice. Try Bock Royal Cuvee 2011. Great, although slightly pricey. (Protip: - 30% at the airport for Bock wines at the moment . Basically, get a great bottle of wine for under a tenner £. Happy days).

### Cafe / dessert

Ruszwurm Cukrászda

Okay, this place seems - and is - a bit touristy but well worth going to. Despite the Google reviewers complaining it's pricey, it is not. Have a bit of a walk up the hill and get the traditional cream cake - brilliant.

### Ruin bars

* Szimpla Kert

Ruin bar, a very cool one. They've got a farmers market on Sundays by the way.

* Élesztő

Ruin bar with small brewery beers. Don't miss if you're into beer. 

### Metal bars 

**Rocktogon**

Nice rock / metal bar. We went there rather early and were the only customers. 

**Manovar pub**

Yes, there is a Manovar -themed bar in Budapest which, as a heavy metal fan, I naturally recommend.

### Where NOT to go

Ruin bar called Instant. Really shit said a local. Looks really shit based on the website. Saw a flyer that said there was a band (or a DJ or something) on called Open Puzzy which is supportive of this claim.
