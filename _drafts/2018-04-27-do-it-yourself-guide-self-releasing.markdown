### Do It Yourself - Guide to writing, recording and releasing your own music

This guide is biased towards self-releasing a heavy metal album. If you think that's not for you, or there's nothing to learn here, stop reading now.

Since I was a kind, I had always thought you'd need a band, fancy gear, a studio, a record label and loads of money to release an album. I mean, hell, all these bands I marvelled at since I was a kid had all of that and more. Mystical things called record labels would control everything and release all the music in the world, to the world. In hindsight I was ~rather~ very ignorant and didn't really even have a desire to release my music I wrote (how could I, I had none) and getting a band was the only way to somehow, magically, come up with stuff and get anywhere.

I have always been shy when it comes to self-expression. With self-expression comes self-doubt. It is daunting: it's your product. You've done it all. You are completely responsible. What if people don't like it? What if they hate it? What if you get ridiculed?

Here's the thing. No-one will care. No-one will even notice. You've just released an album you spent a long time, and perhaps a lot of money, doing --- but so have gazillion other people. Bands that have record labels, propaganda machinery, promoters, years of experience, friends, loyal fans - who will not care you've just released something. As sad as it is, you're completely safe in publishing as, before you find a way to tell the world about it, it will go almost completely unnoticed. That should not be a thing to doubt or worry. If you want to worry, worry about getting people to listen to your stuff and give you feedback so you can improve.

Here's some statistics to ponder. 100,000* albums gets released a year. Most of them, I think in the absence of data, through record labels who will promote and push hard to get it heard as they've financially invested in it one way or another.

I didn't know how to do any of this stuff so I figured it out and learned a lot doing so. I read a lot, watched a lot of Youtube videos and even a Pluralsight guide on Logic Pro X. It took loads of time (hence this guide so you don't have to) but don't be put off by any of it as it was and can be tons of fun. And hey, if it's not fix yourself with a favourite drink of yours and it will be. Guaranteed.

## Getting started

One evening in late 2016, I poured myself a glass of red, picked up the guitar after a 10+ year break of playing and struck a few cords. Fuck I was rusty! I could hardly bend my fingers to reach the chords on my mistreated Tokai Les Paul -copy I bought when I was 19 with some school graduation money. I had never recorded anything but thought to I'd give making some stuff up a try and, in a moment of confidence probably boosted by the red wine, decided to dig out an old Line 6 audio interface, open Garageband and press record. I sounded like shit.

## Why am I writing this

I like to help people. I spent loads of times Googling around, talking to people, learning the very basics, making mistakes, being inefficient as I had no idea on what I was doing,

Here's what I have in mind:

Sure - claimed as the trusty workhorse pretty much everyone and their dog are using. Should have gone for this one earlier.
Sure - I found this great inexpensive alternative to record my acoustic guitar
The cool mic. Well. It does look cool. But I don't really like the soft sound it has. Probably works better for an acoustic project or some soft singing.
