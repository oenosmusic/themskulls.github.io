### Do It Yourself - Guide to writing, recording and releasing your own music

Since I was a kind, I had always thought you'd need a band, fancy gear, a studio, a record label and loads of money to release an album. I mean, hell, all these bands I marvelled since I was a kid had all of that and more. Mystical things called record label would control everything and release all the music in the world, to the world. In hindsight I was ~rather~ very ignorant and didn't really even have a desire to release my music I wrote (how could I, I had none) and getting a band was the only way to somehow, magically, come up with stuff and get anywhere.

I didn't know how to do any of this stuff so I kind of figured it out, and learned a lot doing so. It took loads of time (hence this guide so you don't have to) but don't be daunted by any of it as it was and can be tons of fun. And hey, if it's not fix yourself with a favourite drink of yours and it will be. Guaranteed.

## Getting started

One evening in late 2016, I poured myself a glass of red, picked up the guitar after a 10+ year break of playing and struck a few cords. Fuck I was rusty! I could hardly bend my fingers to reach the chords on my mistreated Tokai Les Paul -copy I bought when I was 19 with some school graduation money. I had never recorded anything but thought to I'd give making some stuff up a try and, in a moment of confidence probably boosted by the red wine, decided to dig out an old Line 6 audio interface, open Garageband and press record. I sounded like shit.

Why am I writing this

I like to help people. I spent loads of times Googling around, talking to people, learning the very basics, making mistakes, being inefficient as I had no idea on what I was doing,

Sure - claimed as the trusty workhorse pretty much everyone and their dog are using. Should have gone for this one earlier.

The cool mic. Well. It does look cool. But I don't really like the soft sound it has. Probably works better for an acoustic project or some soft singing.
