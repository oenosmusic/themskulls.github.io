I really like reading people's top album lists at the end of the year as there's always something new for me. 

Here's my stab on the top 10 albums of the year 2015 - except there were too many so had to settle for 18. 

1. Melechesh - Enki
2. Callisto - Secret Youth
3. Paradise Lost - The Plaque Within
4. Between The Buried and Me - Coma Ecliptic
5. Amorphis - Under The Red Cloud
6. Ghost - Meliora
7. Kauan - Sorni Nai
8. Tesseract - Polaris
9. Enslaved - In Times
10. Riverside - Love, Fear and the Time Machine
11. Cult Of Endtime - In Charnel Lights
12. Mgla - Exercises In Futility
13. Deafheaven - New Bermuda
14. Myrkur - M
15. Steven Wilson - Hand. Cannot. Erase
16. Secrets Of The Sky - Pathway
17. Leprous - The Congregation
18. Cattle Decapitation - The Anthropocene Extinction
