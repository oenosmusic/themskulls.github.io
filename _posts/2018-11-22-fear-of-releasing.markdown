It was veeeeery uncomfortable for me. To release something as personal as music I had made alone was daunting. What if no-one likes it? What if people _hate_ it? What if I will be publicly criticized?

Even thinking about it makes me nervous even though I have, now plenty, of music out in the wild.

Here's some stats on what happened when I first released music via Bandcamp:

That's right. Fuck. All.

How bout this graph then?

A whopping 5 listeners on June 31st. Chances are I told a few friends that day who decided to give it a try.

Let's dig into it more:

1/5 of those listeners actually listened the song fully.

No-one (well, a very limited number) knew about my music and the new release I've just put out. I'm pretty sure the 1 listener was actually me checking how my new track sounded on when listened through Bandcamp.

I could have also always released under a pseudonym, completely anonymously, if I wanted to avoid being personally attached to the music before I had gained more confidence.

If you hesitate - like I did - releasing your music online, I get it. But there's very little reason not to release. No-one will know before you tell them.

What's the worst thing that can happen?
